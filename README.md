This piece by Sally Smart makes use of puppets as a medium for interactivity between artist and audience. "The puppet moves in the space between performer and viewer, whether as a vector for communication between the two or as a buffer to prevent it. It is not alive, but it accepts the life given it by the performer; it cannot speak on its own, but when it does speak, it can say more than either audience or performer would be allowed to say on their own." Sally Smart created this piece in collaboration with the University of Connecticut's School of Fine Arts, with the goal of making the process of its cration the creation itself. I enjoyed this piece as a blend of performative art, material art, and interactive cybernetic art. Though slightly off the mainstream for cybernetics, this piece really does flow around input and output, and I appreciated the rawness with which it did so.

##### Scott Snibbe - Boundary Functions

This piece from 1998 was created by Scott Snibbe, and was shown in various art museums from 1998 until 2008, beginning at the Tech Museum in San Jose and finishing at the Milwaukee Art Museum. This piece explores the idea of personal space and relationships, with viewers as the input for the visual output. Lines projected from overhead move dynamically, separating each person from every other person on the floor. As more people walk onto the space, more lines appear and move as they walk, always ensuring that every person has their own cellular region of space. This simple idea creates a very striking visual image and invokes a compelling idea of interpersonal interaction. "The intangible notion of personal space and the line that always exists between you and another becomes concrete. The installation doesnâ€™t function at all with one person, as it requires a physical relationship to someone else."
